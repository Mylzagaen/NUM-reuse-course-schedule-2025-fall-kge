# Purpose Formalization
## Project Purpose

Our project aims to integrate university course, curriculum, and scheduling data into a unified knowledge graph. This graph will allow students and academic staff to easily identify overlaps between planned courses, selected (enrolled) courses, and curriculum-required courses. By modeling relationships between course schedules, time slots, instructors, and curriculum structures, the graph will support conflict-free planning and improve the accuracy of academic decision-making.

### Scenarios definition
Scenario 1

A first-year student is preparing a study plan for the next semester. They want to know whether their planned courses conflict with each other in terms of time or prerequisites.

Scenario 2

A student has already registered for several courses. Before the semester begins, the student wants to check if their selected courses overlap in timetable or violate curriculum rules.

Scenario 3

An academic advisor needs to verify whether a student's curriculum-required courses have any timing conflicts with the student’s other registered courses.

### Personas
Persona 1: Freshman Naraa

Naraa is a first-year student preparing her planned course list for the next semester. She wants to avoid time conflicts between her selected courses.

Persona 2: Senior Student Bilguun

Bilguun has already enrolled in several elective and major courses. He wants to quickly verify whether his enrolled courses overlap in the timetable.

Persona 3: Academic Advisor Ariunaa

Ariunaa works at the registrar's office and helps students choose courses that match their curriculum. She needs a fast tool to check conflicts between curriculum-required courses and a student's existing schedule.

### Competency Questions (CQs)
CQ 1:

For Naraa, list all time conflicts between her planned courses.

CQ 2:

For Bilguun, detect all timetable overlaps between his selected/enrolled courses.

CQ 3:
