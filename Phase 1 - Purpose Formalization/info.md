# Purpose Formalization
## Project Purpose

Our project aims to integrate university course, curriculum, and scheduling data into a unified knowledge graph. This graph will allow students and academic staff to easily identify overlaps between planned courses, selected (enrolled) courses, and curriculum-required courses. By modeling relationships between course schedules, time slots, instructors, and curriculum structures, the graph will support conflict-free planning and improve the accuracy of academic decision-making. 

### Scenarios definition
- **Scenario 1**

A first-year student is preparing a study plan for the next semester. They want to know whether their planned courses conflict with each other in terms of time or prerequisites.

- **Scenario 2** 

A student has already registered for several courses. Before the semester begins, the student wants to check if their selected courses overlap in timetable or violate curriculum rules.
 
- **Scenario 3**
   
An academic advisor needs to verify whether a student’s curriculum-required courses have any timing conflicts with the student’s other registered courses.

### Personas
- **Persona 1: Freshman Naraa** 

Naraa is a first-year student who is creating her course plan for the next semester. Since she has not taken many courses before, she wants to ensure that the courses she selects do not overlap in time and that she meets all prerequisite requirements. Naraa mainly deals with planned (not yet registered) courses. 

- **Persona 2: Senior Student Bilguun** 

Bilguun is a senior student who has already enrolled in several major and elective courses. He wants a fast way to verify whether his registered courses overlap in the timetable. Unlike Naraa, Bilguun already has a fixed schedule and is checking for conflicts in an existing course list. 

- **Persona 3: Academic Advisor Ariunaa** 

Ariunaa works at the registrar’s office and helps students choose courses that match their curriculum. She needs a fast tool to check conflicts between curriculum-required courses and a student’s existing schedule.

### Competency Questions (CQs)

- **CQ 1:** 

What time conflicts exist between the courses Naraa plans to take for the next semester? 

- **CQ 2:**

Which timetable overlaps occur among the courses that Bilguun has already enrolled in?

- **CQ 3:** 

Do any curriculum-required courses clash with the student’s currently registered schedule?
